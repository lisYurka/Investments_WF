This application allows you to select banks to deposit your money. To make this, I parse the informtaion from website about different deposit's posibility.

This is a main window that includes 3 tabs(from left to right): input data, calculations and quit the app

Here you can input your data about deposit. You can enter next values: deposit type, start amount and currency, deposit term
